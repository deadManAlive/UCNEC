It is a multi-platform and open-source GUI, developed as an undergraduate thesis for the telecommunications school of the faculty of engineering of the University of Carabobo.

Its main functionality is to provide an interactive medium for the simulation of antenna behavior, allowing the visualization of objective results through the electromagnetic code number; in the same way, it allows to design the geometric structure of radiant systems as a series of filaments of a certain length and diameter, indicating the presence of voltage or current sources, charges, transmission lines, spatial characteristics and radiation pattern. In addition, to the parameters provided by NEC2, UCNEC processes the received data to obtain features such as:

* Beam opening
* Side Lobe
* F / B ratio
* Stationary Wave Ratio
* Polarization Diagram
* Minimum SWR frequency
* Antenna Bandwidth
